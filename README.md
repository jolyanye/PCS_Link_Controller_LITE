#PCS Link Controller LITE

##A Compact, Area-Optimized Physical Coding Sublayer for ASIC & FPGA

PCS Link Controller LITE is a compact Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) block that implements an 8b/10b encoding/ decoding pipeline, asynchronous clock domain crossing (CDC) FIFOs, and a Link Training and Status State Machine (LTSSM) arbiter that manages a half-duplex, bidirectional shared data bus. The architecture was tailored to meet the area, memory and standard-cell constraints of the SkyWater 130nm process used by TinyTapeout chips.
